# Terminal Velocity
[docs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_velocity)
Terminal velocity is the maxiumum velocity that an object can fall through a fluid. This limit is caused when the `drag force (F_d)` + `buoyancy` is equal to the `force of gravity`.

Vt = sqrt(2mg/pAC_d)

(Without buoyancy effects)

Vt is terminal velocity
m is the mass of the falling object
g is the acceleration due to gravity
C_d is the `drag coefficient`
p is the `density` of the fluid which the object is falling
A is the `projected area` of the object

An object will reach its terminal speed `asymptotically`.

## Velocity / time to reach terminal velocity

## Derivation
`Ricatti equation` solvable by reducing to a `second-order linear differential equation`.
