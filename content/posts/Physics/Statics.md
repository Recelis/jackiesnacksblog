# Statics
[docs](David Morin Introduction to classical mechanics)
A static setup is where all the objects are motionless. The total external force F = ma on each direction acting on an object is zero.

## Tension
Tension is the general name for a force that a rope, stick, etc exerts when it is pulled on.

## Normal Force
This is a force perpendicular to a surface that the surface applied to an object. The total force applied by surface is usually combination of the normal force and the friction force. The normal force is actually just the compressive force on the surface and can be thought of as just negative tension.

## Friction
Friction is the force parallel to a surface that the surface applies to an object. Two types of friction, `static friction` and `kinetic friction` which is approximately equal to the normal force `F = u_k N`. This section only deals with static friction which is the force with two objects at rest to each other. Static friction is `F <= u_sN`. We can only say that the static friction force has a maximum value of `F_max = u_sN`. This means that in the case of you giving an object lying on a surface a small push that is not enough to move it, the static friction force applied on the object has been less than the `u_s` (the coefficient of static friction).
