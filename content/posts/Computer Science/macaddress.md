# Mac Address

Media access control address is a value assigned to a device by the manufacturer.

They are critical for the use of Wifi, Bluetooth, and Ethernet. It allows routers to identify the device in a network. Mac Addresses work with the **Network Interface Controller (NIC)** and are a 12 digit hexadecimal number with every two numbers separated by a colon or a hyphen. `2C:54:91:88:C9:E3` or `2c-54-91-88-c9-e3`. Large network adapter manufacturers may even have their own locked in prefix for their Mac Address e.g. Dell is 00-14-22.
