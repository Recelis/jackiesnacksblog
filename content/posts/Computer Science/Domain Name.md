# Domain Name

## TLD

(docs)[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/TLD]
The Top Level Domain is the end of a domain name. An example are .org and .com.
TLDs can be grouped (by IANA - the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority, a subsidary of ICANN the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers) to country-code, internatlized country code, generic, unsponsored (edu or .com), sponsored (controlled by a private organisation) and the infrastructure top level domain which is just .arpa.
