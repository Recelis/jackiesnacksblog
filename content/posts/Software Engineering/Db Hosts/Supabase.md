## Supabase Auth

### Supabase Users
[docs](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/users)
A user in Supabase has a user ID which is stored in the Auth schema. They can be issued with an Access Token to access Supabase endpoints. Access can be restricted to resources via `RLS policies` found in Postgres.
