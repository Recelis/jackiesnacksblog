# S3
S3 is a way to store data.

## Main Concepts
Data is organised in **Buckets** which are containers for **Objects** in S3. Buckets need a name and a region. Name and region cannot be changed after creation. The name and the key of the object uniquely identify the bucket (and also version if you have versioning turned on). To figure out the bucket name and key, you can look at the url of the bucket. `https://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/photos/puppy.jpg`, `DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET` is the name of the bucket and `photos/puppy.jpg` is the key.

## Access Management and Security
(docs)[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/access-control-best-practices.html]
You can access buckets by defining an `Access Control List` (ACL) or set up a `Bucket Policy`. You can also change the Block Public Access but most of the time, you should keep this fully on.

### Access Control List
These are lists that allow specific users (or access groups) access to the bucket.

### Bucket Policy
You can define policies on who `Principals` can access your bucket and how. A typical policy looks like this:


```javascript
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Id": "S3PolicyId1",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "IPAllow",
            "Effect": "Deny",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": "s3:*",
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET",
                "arn:aws:s3:::DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/*"
            ],
            "Condition": {
                "IpAddress": {
                    "aws:SourceIp": [
                        "192.0.2.0/24",
                        "2001:DB8:1234:5678::/64"
                    ]
                },
                "NotIpAddress": {
                    "aws:SourceIp": [
                        "203.0.113.0/24",
                        "2001:DB8:1234:5678:ABCD::/80"
                    ]
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

### Cloudfront OAI
You can also access the bucket via an Cloudfront Origin Access Identity. This allows you to access the bucket only via Cloudfront. The bucket policy is as follows:

```javascript
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Id": "PolicyForCloudFrontPrivateContent",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::cloudfront:user/CloudFront Origin Access Identity EH1HDMB1FH2TC"
            },
            "Action": "s3:GetObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/*"
        }
    ]
}
```
But you can define this in your CDK distribution settings.

(docs)[https://awstip.com/static-website-hosting-with-cloudfront-s3-using-cdk-python-0dd0d54c4c02]
```python
    cf_source_configuration = _cloudfront.SourceConfiguration(
        s3_origin_source=_cloudfront.S3OriginConfig(
            s3_bucket_source=static_site_assets_bkt,
            origin_access_identity=static_site_oai
        ),
        behaviors=[
            _cloudfront.Behavior(
                is_default_behavior=True,
                compress=True,
                allowed_methods=_cloudfront.CloudFrontAllowedMethods.ALL,
                cached_methods=_cloudfront.CloudFrontAllowedCachedMethods.GET_HEAD
            )
        ]
    )
```
