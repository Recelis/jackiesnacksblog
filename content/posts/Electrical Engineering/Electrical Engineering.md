# Electricity

## Voltage
Measured in Volts (V). This is a the charge difference between two points.

## Current
Measured in Amperes (A) and denoted as I. The rate at which charge is flowing.

## Resistance
Measured in Ohms (Ω). This is the material's tendency to resist the current.

`R = p l /A`
Where p is the resistivity of the material in ohm meters and l is the length and A is the cross-sectional area.

## Ohm's Law
`V = IR`
This is the relationship between voltage, current and resistance where the voltage determines the
product of the flow and the resistance. Typically, an engineer will have control over the voltage and the resistance of the material, while the current is the result of these two properties.

## Capacitance
Capacitance is the ratio between the Voltage difference between two plates and the charges difference between those same two plates.
`q = Cv`
Where C is the capacitance of the capacitor and measured in Farads (F). One Farad is equal to 1 coulomb / volt.

Capacitance of a capacitor is calculated from its physical properties.
`C = ∈A/d`
Where ∈ is the permittivity of the dielectric material. A is the surface area of the plates and d the distance between the plates. This assumes the capacitor is made up of parallel plates.
