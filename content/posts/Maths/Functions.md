Hyperbolic functions are similar to ordinary `trigonometric functions` except that they are defined by the `hyperbola`.

Main hyperbolic functions are:
- `hyperbolic sine sinh`
- `hyperbolic cosine cosh`

And then you can derive the rest:
- `hyperbolic tangent tanh`
- `hyperbolic cotangent coth`
- `hypoerbolic secant sech`
- `hyperbolic cosecant csch`

You have the inverses as well.

# Definition
You can define them using `exponentials`, `differential equations`, and even `complex trigonometric functions`. You can even express them as `Taylor series expressions`.

The inverses are `logarithms`.
