## Learning OOP

Looking at the [C# Beginner tutorial](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tour-of-csharp/). It looks like C# is the language (no sh\*t sherlock!) and that .NET is the engine that actually runs the code. Sort of how like NodeJS with its V8 engine runs Javascript. I am sure that these are vastly different technologies but in the scope of this document, we can say that are roughly equivalent.
