JackieSnacks is a second brain built with Hugo. It records all of Jacky Lui's DALs (Directionless Active Learnings), a term that he created for the time he assigns himself to look up terms and phrases of things he comes upon and doesn't know much about. 

# Directionless Active Learning
A DAL is starts off as something that Jacky comes upon i.e. `path`? This might be with a context such as `Javascript library`.  He would then note this down in a list of his notebook and he would 'pop' off or pull off one item on that list daily.

These notes are all built as trees where each note might exist only under one logical `parent`. However, they will eventually be set so that they may have multiple parents and multiple children. Forming a web instead.
