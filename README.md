# Jackie Snacks Blog

Welcome to the JackieSnacks blog created by me, Jacky. I know that there is a typo in my name. However, this is a legacy decision. I started my first blog named JackieSnacks in 2014. Almost 10 years since the creation of this blog, and have decided to get back into blogging. So that is why I've chosen a blog name with a misspelling of my own name.

My 'blogs' these days will mostly be a place for talking about the mostly technical things that I've learnt, and some musings about how I can complete my projects to a satisfactory level i.e. hopefully actually turning a dollar from them instead of continuing sinking money to DigitalOcean and AWS.


## DAL
The first major thing that I will talk about is an acronym that I made up called DAL. This stands for `Directionless Active Learning` and it means that I am actively learning but in a `directionless` manner. This is a cop out because I don't need to go through formal training courses. Which can take a long time and is not very practical for me working in tech where I come across quite a lot of technologies over a given week. So with DALs I jot down an unfamiliar term or a phrase that might pop up over during the day and then later on 
look into that a little bit. At the very least, take some notes on that. I may write a priorisiation algorithm to show me the next thing to pick up but at the moment, it really is pick something off the list that looks interesting and useful and learn about it a little bit.

This is built with `hugo` which is written with `go` and so is apparently very solid (with no capitalisation) tech that doesn't change much.

You'll need to set up all prerequisites on your computer to get this going. Look in the [Hugo Docs](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/usage/).
